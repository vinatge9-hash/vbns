How to run
- Open any of the HTML files in a modern browser to view the site.
- All styling is done with Tailwind CSS utility classes loaded via CDN.

Customization tips
- Change the hero background by modifying the inline style in index.html and about.html. Use the provided placeholder image syntax: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1634400414538-d3c0fc2bc63b?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw3fHxkZXNjcmlwdGlvbnxlbnwwfDB8fHwxNzU4NjMxOTI0fDA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080.
- Update content in the Services section of index.html to reflect your actual offerings.
- For branding, adjust the heading fonts by replacing the font-[primary-font] and font-[secondary-font] placeholders in your own environment (the system will inject category-appropriate font stacks).
- Replace placeholder images with actual assets or swap in more https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1756758187555-711f3075e90f?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwzfHwuLi58ZW58MHwwfHx8MTc1ODYxMDY3M3ww&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080 placeholders as needed.

Accessibility & QA notes

- Ensure links between pages are intact to allow smooth navigation.
